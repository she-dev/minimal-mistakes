So, you got started with React Native and is seeing some progress on the simulator but now you want to see your app running on a real device. In this tutorial you'll learn how to generate the APK to download and install your app on an Android phone. 

We'll assume that you already have done the setup to run the Android emulator on your computer. Make sure to do it first because if you haven't done it your build will not succeed as the basic setup is necessary for generating the APK. Check the [React Native documentation](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) if necessary.
